# DOOM

Doom (stylized as DOOM) is an American media franchise created by John Carmack, John Romero, Adrian Carmack, Kevin Cloud, and Tom Hall.[1] The series usually focuses on the exploits of an unnamed space marine (often referred to as Doomguy or Doom Slayer) operating under the auspices of the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC), who fights hordes of demons and the undead to save Earth from an apocalyptic invasion.

The original Doom is considered one of the first pioneering first-person shooter games, introducing to IBM-compatible computers features such as 3D graphics, third-dimension spatiality, networked multiplayer gameplay, and support for player-created modifications with the Doom WAD format. Over ten million copies of games in the Doom series have been sold; the series has spawned numerous sequels, novels, comic books, board games, and film adaptations. 

The Doom video games consist of first-person shooters in which the player controls an unnamed space marine commonly referred to as Doomguy; in the 2016 series, the protagonist is called the "Doom Slayer" or just "Slayer" in later entries. The player battles the forces of Hell, consisting of demons and the undead. The games are usually set within sprawling bases on Mars or its moons, while some parts occur in Hell. The classic series had only a minimal focus on the narrative, much of which was in the manuals rather than the games.[2] More recent titles, notably the 2016 series, would feature a heavier focus on narrative.[3]

The original game featured eight weapons, designed so that no weapon became obsolete after the acquisition of another. With the player carrying all these weapons at once, the strategy of "gun juggling"—rapidly switching between the weapons depending on circumstance—can be employed.[4] Outside of combat mechanics, Doom levels often feature mazes, colored key cards and hidden areas.[5][6] As the genre was in its infancy in the early 1990s, the player could not jump or look up and down in the classic series due to technical limitations. Some limited platforming was however present, as players could sprint at gaps and let their momentum carry them to a destination.[7] These features were added in newer titles,[8] with the 2016 series in particular featuring a strong focus on platforming.[9] 

The development of the original Doom started in 1992, when John Carmack developed a new game engine, the Doom engine, while the rest of the id Software team finished the Wolfenstein 3D prequel, Spear of Destiny. The game launched in an episodic format in 1993, with the first episode available as shareware and two more episodes available by mail order. The first episode was largely designed by John Romero.[10] The title proved extremely popular, with the full version of the game selling one million copies. The term "Doom clone" became the name for new genre now known as first-person shooters for several years.[11]
